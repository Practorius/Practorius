- 👋 Hi, I’m @Practorius
- 👀 I’m interested in data and all that I can (or not) do with it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all kinds of things, but for now: Python, Processing, Arduino, Azure
- 🌴 I'm allready fluent in SAS, SQL, Power BI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data intelligence
- 📫 How to reach me: Since I just started on GitHub, I will leave this black for now
